Did you miss part one of our new house tour? [Check it out here](http://localhost:4000/2015/06/09/welcome_to_our_house.html), but remember:

**WARNING: THESE PHOTOS ARE ROUGH, BUT IF YOU SQUINT AND LISTEN TO “EYE OF THE TIGER” ON YOUR HEADPHONES, YOU REALLY START TO SEE THE BUILDING’S POTENTIAL. TRUST ME ON THIS.**

OK let’s get back to business. The new house! Now where did we leave off?

Ahh, the first-floor rental unit. You know – where our antiques- and cat-loving tenants will live.

###THE FIRST-FLOOR DINING ROOM

You got a sneak peek of the dining room when I showed you the living room, and a lot of the changes for the front room apply to this one, too. And there’s a cool hutch, which will look fantastic full of Fiestaware. Because those tenants will be obsessed with it, too, of course.

#####The sunny dining room and focal point … that hutch!

#####This view is opposite that weird framed brick section in the previous photo. The door on the right leads to a hallway closet, which will (someday) include a basement staircase for indoor access, as well as the hallway that leads to the building’s front door. The door on the left is one of the unit’s three small bedrooms, which will (someday) be combined with another bedroom to make a larger space.

A few of our plans for the dining room include:

- Peel off that parquet tile and expose (then refinish) the original hardwood underneath.

- Strip the wallpaper, which has been painted, and repair the existing plaster when necessary. Paint the room some spectacular color (still TBD) and paint all the trim white.

- Take off that partial brick wall and weird tile surround, which is awkward and once served as the backdrop to some gas space heater.

- Paint ceiling and install crown molding.

… and more, probably.

Plans for the hutch are still yet to be determined. I mean, the one in our current apartment is painted white to match the trim, which I LOVE, but maybe we’ll go a different route here. Who knows? Maybe it will come to us in a dream. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.

###TWO FIRST-FLOOR BEDROOMS WILL EVENTUALLY BE ONE

This unit, which we’ll rent out when ( … if?) we ever finish construction, currently has three bedrooms, which are all super teensy and would MAYBE fit a single child’s bed in each. None of the bedrooms even have closets, which has been the main struggle in our current apartment and is a huge consideration in construction plans moving forward.

People need closets, you guys. I’m tired of shoving clothes under spare beds and into random nooks and crannies.

#####Tiny room No. 1, which is … tiny.

#####Behind the door is a shoddy chipboard partition that constantly makes me want to run and bust through it.

#####View into tiny room No. 2 from the doorway, which is also … tiny.

The rooms are awkward as-is, but could possibly remain awkward once that partition and wall are removed. Gonna have to brainstorm more on this front (the tiny opening between the building exterior and the interior hallway means we have to get creative), but we know a few things for sure. Here are a few plans for this room(s) renovation:

- Refinish the hardwood floors, which are currently PAINTED and will require a billion sheets of sandpaper.

- Knock down that wall between rooms and close up one of the entry doors. Jury’s still out whether James and I will actually get to bust through the partition like the Kool-Aid Man.

- Strip the wallpaper and repair existing plaster when necessary. Paint the room some really bomb-ass color, and paint the trim bright white.

- Build a closet that would make Lisa Vanderpump weep.

- Figure out the room’s purpose and potential set-up … will it simply be a bedroom and closet? Will it be a bedroom and closet, plus bonus seating area or office? The possibilities are endless, which makes this decision way harder

… and probably a billion other things that will come to us during construction.

All things considered, you might think this construction project isn’t all that crazypants. And you might be right … so far. There’s still the kitchen. And there’s still our owner’s unit, which is in worse shape than this one by a long shot. Basically the entire unit is painted the color of baby poop, so there’s that.
