#New Conroy Venture

For about the last three-quarters of WDI _(a little more than two months)_ I've been involved in a very important project that has taken a lot of time away from class. If you've noticed my absence at any point recently, hopefully things will make more sense soon.

#Expected Launch Date

In recent weeks this project has evolved, and is expected to continue growing for the
foreseeable future. Our expected launch date of this project is January 2016, so there is still quite a lot of work to do.

#Who's Working on This?
Together with my co-founder, we expect to be working on this project to be a huge part of our lives. However, we will need funding to see the project reach its fullest potential. Current estimates suggest we will need at least $300,000. However, with expansion of our product those costs will rise.

#Is It Scalable?
After the initial launch we'll have a much better idea if this project can be iterated. With success of the first iteration, we will likely copy the process at least one other time.

#But, Is It Social?
It's so fucking social. It's like going to be crazy social when it launches, you don't even know.

##Coming January 2016
